## Blockchain
My main interest in blockchain development is writing and testing chain code, smart contracts for EVM blockchain based alternative coins or Ethereum using both C++ and Solidity. I would like to say that Remix IDE is really great. I am also working on a few Hyperledger projects. Stay tuned!



Are you interested in how to get started with blockchain development or how to create your own cryptocurrency?!
Please feel free to contact me anytime.
